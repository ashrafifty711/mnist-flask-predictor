# MNIST Digit Predictor Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload handwritten digit images (28x28 grayscale) and predicts the digit using a pre-trained ONNX model. It also displays the confidence scores for each digit class using a bar chart.

---

## Features

The web application allows users to upload their own digit images for prediction, offering a preview of the selected image before the prediction is processed. It displays the predicted digit along with a probability distribution visualized using Chart.js. Users can also test the model using built-in sample MNIST digit images for convenience. Additionally, the app includes error handling mechanisms to manage invalid or missing file uploads, ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Flask (Python)** for backend web server
- **onnxruntime** for model inference
- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** for the frontend
- **Chart.js** for visualizing prediction confidence

## ðŸ›  Error Handling

If the uploaded file is not an image, it cannot be selected due to input restrictions. Additionally, if the predict button is clicked without selecting a file, an error popup will appear prompting the user to upload an image first.

---

## ðŸ“· Sample Images

- The web page includes clickable sample MNIST digits (0â€“9) that users can test without uploading their own images.
